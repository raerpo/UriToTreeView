# URI to JSON Tree View
This utility provides a easy way to visualize a JSON or an URI encoded JSON string.

## Example
Imagine that you have this URI string that represents a JSON Object:

`%7B%22hello%22%3A%22world%22%7D`

That string is URI encoded and match with the following JSON:

`{"hello":"world"}`

This utility allows to see a nice and interactive JSON tree view of either one of these inputs.
